# mern_stack_book
Developing a simple CRUD application from scratch.

To show how the MERN stack works, we first configure the server side by connecting Node.js and Express.js to MongoDB on the backend. Then, we create some APIs. After that, we build the frontend, using React to build our user interfaces. then we connect the frontend to the backend.
